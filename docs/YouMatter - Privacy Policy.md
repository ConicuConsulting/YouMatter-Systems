YouMatter is committed to protecting the privacy and confidentiality of our patients' data. This Privacy Policy outlines how we collect, use, store, and protect personal information, particularly in relation to patient data. By using YouMatter, you consent to the terms outlined in this policy.

### 1. Information We Collect

We collect patient data as part of our Patient Administration System (PAS) and Electronic Health Record (EHR) services. The types of information we may collect include, but are not limited to:

- Patient demographic information (e.g., age, gender)
- Medical history and treatment records
- Pathology data

### 2. Purpose of Data Collection

The data collected through YouMatter is used solely for the following purposes:

- To enhance healthcare delivery and operational efficiencies within hospitals and clinics.
- To conduct anonymized medical research that aims to improve patient care and outcomes.

### 3. Anonymization of Data

YouMatter prioritizes patient confidentiality. All data used for medical research will be anonymized, meaning that any identifying information will be removed or generalized to prevent the identification of individual patients. For example:

- Specific dates of birth may be replaced with a general Month-Year format.
- Any other identifiable information will be stripped to ensure that patients cannot be matched back to their data.

### 4. Child Patient Data

YouMatter recognizes the importance of protecting the privacy of child patients. Identifying data of child patients will not be accessible without the explicit consent of their parent or guardian. If consent is granted by the parent or guardian, we will contact them regarding the specific research or use of their child's data.

### 5. Research Use of Data

Data collected from patients will only be utilized for medical research purposes. We do not allow forensics or law enforcement access to patient data through YouMatter. We understand the importance of patient trust, and we are committed to ensuring that our platform is used to support healthcare and research institutions only.

### 6. Patient Consent and Contact

In the event that a research organization wishes to contact a patient regarding results derived from research purposes, they may request this information from the relevant hospital. Patients will be contacted only if they have opted in to receive such communications.

### 7. Data Security

YouMatter employs robust data security measures to protect patient information. We utilize advanced encryption methods and secure cloud infrastructure to safeguard data against unauthorized access and breaches.

### 8. Commitment to Confidentiality

As a company, YouMatter stands firmly by our values and objectives, which prioritize the confidentiality of patient data. Regardless of a patient's past, we believe that their data deserves to be treated with the utmost confidentiality and respect. We are dedicated to maintaining the trust of our patients and healthcare partners and will not compromise this for any external interests.
