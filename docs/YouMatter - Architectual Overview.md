## YouMatter Cloud Architecture Technical Document

### Overview
This document outlines the cloud architecture for the YouMatter project. It includes a detailed flowchart depicting the interactions between various components and an overview of the architecture, including user web client, Azure AD, DNS, Azure Front Door, Content Delivery Network (CDN), App Layer, Data Layer, and Hybrid Deployment with Azure Arc.

### Cloud Architecture Components

#### User Web Client
- **Device Agnostic Web Client**: Accessible from any device, anywhere, providing a seamless user experience.

#### Azure AD
- **Single Sign-On (SSO)**: Centralized authentication for all users.
- **User Identity Management**: Manages user identities and access.
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Implemented through Azure AD.
- **Conditional Access Policies**: Enforces security policies based on user and device context.

#### DNS
- **Public DNS Server**: Resolves the hospital's custom domain to the YouMatter system.

#### Azure Front Door
- **Global Load Balancing**: Distributes incoming traffic across multiple regions for high availability and performance.
- **Enhanced Performance and Availability**: Routes user requests to the lowest latency resource.

#### Content Delivery Network (CDN)
- **Caching**: Stores static content closer to users to improve load times and reduce latency.

#### App Layer (Microservices)
- **Containerized Backend Services**: Managed by Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS).
- **Microservices Architecture**: Handles specific functionalities such as patient management, bed allocation, and discharge processes.

#### Data Layer
- **Azure Cosmos DB**: Manages unstructured data, highly available and scalable.
- **Azure SQL DB**: Stores structured data like patient records.
- **Azure Search**: Provides search capabilities across data.
- **Redis Cache**: Improves data retrieval speeds by caching frequently accessed data.

#### Hybrid Deployment with Azure Arc
- **Extends Azure Management**: Allows management of on-premises infrastructure with Azure services.
- **Azure Arc-enabled Kubernetes**: Manages Kubernetes clusters across on-premises and Azure.
- **Azure Arc-enabled SQL Server**: Extends Azure SQL capabilities to on-premises SQL Server instances.

### Detailed Cloud Architecture

#### High-Level Architecture Flowchart

1. **User Authentication**
   - User accesses the YouMatter system through a device-agnostic web client.
   - DNS resolves the custom domain to the YouMatter system hosted on Azure.
   - User is authenticated through Azure AD, which provides single sign-on (SSO) and role-based access control (RBAC).

2. **Request Routing**
   - Azure Front Door handles global load balancing, routing user requests to the lowest latency resource.
   - Content Delivery Network (CDN) caches static content closer to the user, improving load times.

3. **Microservices Management**
   - Backend services are containerized and managed by Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS).
   - The App Layer consists of various microservices handling specific functionalities.

4. **Data Management**
   - The Data Layer includes Azure Cosmos DB for unstructured data and Azure SQL DB for structured data.
   - Redis Cache is used to cache frequently accessed data for faster retrieval.
   - Azure Search facilitates search capabilities across the data.

5. **Hybrid Deployment (if required)**
   - Extends Azure management and services to on-premises infrastructure using Azure Arc.
   - Manages Kubernetes clusters across both on-premises and Azure environments.
   - Extends Azure SQL capabilities to on-premises SQL Server instances.

### Component Overview

1. **User Web Client**
   - **Device Agnostic**: Accessible from any device.
   - **Universal Access**: Connect from anywhere.

2. **AzureAD**
   - **Single Sign-On**: Unified login experience.
   - **Identity Management**: Handles user identities.
   - **RBAC**: Manages roles and permissions.
   - **Conditional Access**: Policies enforced for security.

3. **DNS**
   - **Public DNS**: Resolves the custom domain.

4. **Azure Front Door**
   - **Global Load Balancing**: Distributes traffic efficiently.
   - **Enhanced Performance**: Routes to the lowest latency resource.

5. **Content Delivery Network (CDN)**
   - **Caching**: Reduces latency and improves load times.

6. **App Layer (Microservices)**
   - **Containerized Services**: Managed by AKS.
   - **Microservices**: Specific functionalities for patient management.

7. **Data Layer**
   - **Azure Cosmos DB**: For unstructured data.
   - **Azure SQL DB**: For structured data.
   - **Redis Cache**: Caches data for faster access.
   - **Azure Search**: Provides search functionality.

8. **Hybrid Deployment with Arc**
   - **Azure Management Extension**: Manages on-premises infrastructure.
   - **Kubernetes Management**: Across on-premises and Azure.
   - **SQL Server Extension**: Extends SQL capabilities to on-premises.
