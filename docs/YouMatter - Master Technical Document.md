### YouMatter PAS System - Master Technical Document

#### 1. Introduction

**Current Problem:**
The healthcare industry is currently plagued by Patient Administration Systems (PAS) that suffer from poor functionality and usability. Many existing PAS applications are outdated, inefficient, and unable to meet the modern needs of hospitals and healthcare providers. These systems often lead to increased administrative burdens, delayed patient care, and overall dissatisfaction among healthcare professionals.

**Why is it the way it is:**
The primary reason for this issue is the disproportionate allocation of funds towards medical advancements, leaving core hospital systems underfunded and neglected. While cutting-edge medical technologies are crucial, the lack of investment in administrative and operational systems creates a significant bottleneck in hospital efficiency and patient care.

**How We Are Fixing It:**
YouMatter aims to address these issues by developing a modern, user-friendly PAS that integrates seamlessly with hospital workflows. The YouMatter PAS will leverage advanced technologies such as Azure AD for authentication, microservices architecture for scalability, and robust data storage solutions to ensure reliability and performance. Our goal is to reduce administrative burdens, improve patient care, and enhance overall hospital efficiency.
