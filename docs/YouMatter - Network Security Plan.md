# YouMatter Network Security Plan

## Introduction

### Purpose
The purpose of this Network Security Plan is to outline the security measures and protocols implemented to protect the YouMatter Patient Administration System (PAS) from unauthorized access, data breaches, and other security threats. This plan ensures the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of sensitive patient data while complying with regulatory requirements such as HIPAA and GDPR.

### Scope
This plan covers all aspects of network security for the YouMatter PAS, including network architecture, security policies, perimeter security, monitoring and logging, endpoint security, patch management, incident response, best practices, and regulatory compliance.

## Network Architecture

### Network Diagram
The network diagram provides a visual representation of the network topology, including key components such as routers, firewalls, switches, servers, and endpoints. 

### Network Segmentation
The network is segmented into multiple zones to minimize the impact of potential security breaches:
- **Public Zone**: Accessible to users via the internet, containing the Azure Front Door and CDN.
- **Application Zone**: Hosts the web servers and microservices.
- **Database Zone**: Contains the Azure SQL Database Managed Instance and on-premises SQL Server for sensitive data storage.
- **Management Zone**: Contains management tools and services for monitoring and maintenance.

## Security Policies and Procedures

### Access Control Policies
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Users are assigned roles based on their job functions, and access to resources is restricted accordingly. Roles include Doctor, Nurse, Allied Health Professional, Administration, Finance, and HR.
- **Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC)**: Access decisions are based on attributes such as user role, resource type, and environmental factors.
- **Principle of Least Privilege**: Users are granted the minimum level of access necessary to perform their tasks.

### Authentication and Authorization
- **Azure Active Directory (Azure AD)**: Manages user authentication and authorization.
- **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**: Provides an additional layer of security by requiring users to verify their identity using multiple methods.

### Data Protection Policies
- **Encryption**: Data is encrypted at rest and in transit using industry-standard encryption protocols.
- **Secure Data Handling**: Policies and procedures for handling sensitive data are enforced to prevent unauthorized access and data breaches.

## Perimeter Security

### Firewall Configuration
- **Network Firewalls**: Configured to block unauthorized access while allowing legitimate traffic.
- **Web Application Firewalls (WAF)**: Protect web applications by filtering and monitoring HTTP traffic between the web application and the internet.

### Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems (IDPS)
- **IDPS**: Monitors network traffic for suspicious activities and provides alerts and automated responses to potential threats.

## Network Monitoring and Logging

### Monitoring Tools
- **Azure Monitor**: Provides continuous monitoring of network traffic, performance, and security events.
- **Azure Sentinel**: A security information and event management (SIEM) solution that offers advanced threat detection and response capabilities.

### Logging and Auditing
- **Comprehensive Logging**: All access and activities are logged, and logs are regularly reviewed to identify and address security issues.
- **Regular Audits**: Conducted to ensure compliance with security policies and regulatory requirements.

## Endpoint Security

### Antivirus and Anti-Malware
- **Antivirus Software**: Ensures all endpoints are protected from viruses and malware.
- **Regular Scans and Updates**: Antivirus and anti-malware software are regularly updated, and scans are conducted to detect and remove threats.

### Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR)
- **EDR Solutions**: Provide advanced threat detection and response capabilities for endpoints.

## Patch Management

### Patch Deployment
- **Regular Updates**: All software and systems are regularly updated to protect against known vulnerabilities.
- **Automated Deployment**: Patches are deployed automatically to minimize the risk of security breaches.

### Patch Testing
- **Controlled Environment Testing**: Patches are tested in a controlled environment before deployment to production systems.

## Incident Response Plan

### Incident Detection
- **Monitoring Tools**: Used to detect and report security incidents in real-time.
- **User Reporting**: Users are encouraged to report suspicious activities.

### Response Procedures
- **Containment**: Steps to isolate and contain the incident to prevent further damage.
- **Eradication**: Measures to remove the threat from the environment.
- **Recovery**: Procedures to restore affected systems and data.
- **Communication**: Clear communication protocols for notifying stakeholders and regulatory bodies.

### Post-Incident Review
- **Lessons Learned**: Reviews are conducted after incidents to identify lessons learned and improve future response efforts.

## Best Practices

### Zero Trust Architecture
- **Zero Trust Principles**: No entity, whether inside or outside the network, is trusted by default. All access requests are authenticated, authorized, and encrypted.

### Regular Security Assessments
- **Security Assessments**: Regular assessments and penetration testing are conducted to identify and remediate vulnerabilities.

## Compliance and Regulatory Requirements

### HIPAA Compliance
- **HIPAA**: Ensures all network security measures comply with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA).

### GDPR Compliance
- **GDPR**: For EU residents, ensures compliance with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).

### Local Regulations
- **Local Regulatory Requirements**: Adheres to any additional local regulatory requirements relevant to your organization.

## Implementation of Network Security Measures

### Azure Front Door Configuration
- Configure Azure Front Door for global load balancing and WAF policies.
- Set up URL-based routing and session affinity as needed.

### Detailed Firewall Rules
- Define Network Security Groups (NSGs) and Application Security Groups (ASGs) for access control.
- Regularly audit firewall rules to ensure security and compliance.

### Encryption Key Management
- Use Azure Key Vault for storing and managing encryption keys.
- Implement RBAC and key rotation policies to maintain security.

### Backup and Recovery
- Configure automated backups for Azure SQL Database Managed Instance and on-premises SQL Server.
- Use Azure Recovery Services Vault for VM backups with geo-redundant storage.

### Training and Awareness
- Develop and implement a comprehensive security training program.
- Conduct regular phishing simulations and incident response drills.

### Third-Party Risk Management
- Perform risk assessments for third-party vendors and include security requirements in contracts.
- Use third-party risk management tools for continuous monitoring.
